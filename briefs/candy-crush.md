Candy Crush is a game where players swap colored pieces of candy on a game board to make a match of three or more of the same color in either a row or column. Players can swap any candy on the board as long as it will make a 'crush', so they can't swap two candies if doesn't create a row or column of candies of the same color. New random candies are generated at the top so there is a continuous fall of candy as the user crushes.

There is either a time or a number of moves contraints by which the player should reach a minimum amount of points - or they lose.

## Requirements

* The player should be able to crush candies and the candies should drop down to replace the crushed ones. 
* You should display whether the player passed the minimum score or not at the end of the game.

## Suggested enhancements

* Add a 'high score' feature
* Add different levels
* Create different types of candies which act differently to the basic candy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FytVnTyBnm4)

## Challenges

The most difficult aspect of this game is to check the whole board after each crush. So that as the candies drop to replace the crushed ones, the board should clear any other matches that result from the shift of the pieces.
